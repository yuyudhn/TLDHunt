# TLDHunt - Domain Availability Checker
TLDHunt is a command-line tool designed to help users find available domain names for their online projects or businesses. By providing a list of keywords and a list of TLD (top-level domain) extensions, TLDHunt checks the availability of domain names that match the given criteria. This tool is particularly useful for those who want to quickly find a domain name that is not already taken, without having to perform a manual search on a domain registrar website.

For red teaming or phishing purposes, this tool can help you to find similar domains with different extensions from the original domain.

# Dependencies
This tool is written in Bash and the only dependency required is **whois**. Therefore, make sure that you have installed whois on your system. In Debian, you can install whois using the following command:
```
sudo apt install whois -y
```
In Arch:
```
sudo pacman -S whois
```

# How It Works?
To detect whether a domain is registered or not, we search for the words "**Name Server**", "**nserver**", "**nameservers**", or "**status: active**" in the output of the WHOIS command, as this is a signature of a registered domain (thanks to [Alex Matveenko](https://github.com/Alex-Matveenko) for the suggestion). 

In addition to this detection method, the script now handles error messages from WHOIS to avoid false positives for available domains. It also checks for premium domains, allowing users to exclude them from the results. Furthermore, there are options to adjust the delay between requests, enable quiet mode to suppress error messages, and use both single keywords or a list of keywords from a file. The flags have been expanded to provide more flexibility when specifying domains and TLDs.

If you have a better signature or detection method, please feel free to submit a pull request.

# Domain Extension List
For default Top Level Domain list (tlds.txt), we use data from https://data.iana.org.
You can use your custom list, but make sure that it is formatted like this:
```
.aero
.asia
.biz
.cat
.com
.coop
.info
.int
.jobs
.mobi
```

Usage: ./tldhunt.sh [-k <keyword> | -K <keyword-file>] [-t <tld> | -T <tld-file>] [-d <time>] [-q] [-x] [-n] [-xn] [-h]

Options:
  -k,  --keyword             <keyword>       Specify a single keyword.
  -K,  --keyword-file        <file>          Use a file containing a list of keywords.
  -t,  --tld                 <tld>           Specify a single top-level domain (TLD).
  -T,  --tld-file            <file>          Use a file containing a list of TLDs.
  -d,  --delay               <time>          Set the delay time between requests. Default: 0.5s.
  -q,  --quiet                               Suppress error messages and display only results.
  -x,  --not-registered                      Show only unregistered domains.
  -n,  --no-premium                          Show only non-premium domains.
  -xn, --unreg-noprem                        Combination of -x and -n.
  -h,  --help                                Display this help message.

Examples:
  ./tldhunt.sh -K linuxsec.txt -t .com
  ./tldhunt.sh -k linuxsec -t .com
  ./tldhunt.sh -k linuxsec -T tlds.txt
  ./tldhunt.sh -k linuxsec -T tlds.txt -x
  ./tldhunt.sh -k linuxsec -T tlds.txt -n
  ./tldhunt.sh -k linuxsec -T tlds.txt -xn
  ./tldhunt.sh -k linuxsec -T tlds.txt -d 2
  ./tldhunt.sh -k linuxsec -T tlds.txt -q
```
Example of TLDHunt usage:

Use default TLD list
```bash
./tldhunt.sh -k linuxsec -T tlds.txt
```
Use custom TLD list
```bash
./tldhunt.sh -k linuxsec -T custom-tld.txt
```
Use a list of keywords:
```bash
./tldhunt.sh -K linuxsec.txt -T .me
```
You can add `-d` or `--delay` to set the **delay** time between requests. Default: 0.5s. Example:
```bash
./tldhunt.sh -k linuxsec -T tlds.txt -d 0.7
```
You can add `-q` or `--quiet` **suppress error** messages and display only results. Example:
```bash
./tldhunt.sh -k linuxsec -T tlds.txt -q
```
You can add `-x` or `--not-registered` flag to print only **not registered** domain. Example:
```bash
./tldhunt.sh -k linuxsec -T tlds.txt --not-registered
```
You can add `-n` or `--not-premium` flag to print only **available and not premium** domain. Example:
```bash
./tldhunt.sh -k linuxsec -T tlds.txt -n
```
You can add `-xn` or `-nx` or `--unreg-noprem` flag to print only **available and not premium and not registrar** domain. Example:
```bash
./tldhunt.sh -k linuxsec -T tlds.txt -xn
```
You can add `-h` or `--help` flag to print instruction. Example:
```bash
./tldhunt.sh -h
```

# Note
If you see a lot of 'connect: Network is unreachable' errors, you have been blocked due to too many requests in a short period. Try again later and increase the delay.

Recent enhancements, such as error handling, premium domain filtering, and flexible flag options, were added by [h1pp0crates](https://github.com/h1pp0crates).
